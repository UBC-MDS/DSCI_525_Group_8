    "Milestone 2: Your team is planning to migrate to the cloud. AWS gave 400$ (100$ each) to your team to support this. As part of this initiative, your team needs to set up a server in the cloud, a collaborative environment for your team, and later move your data to the cloud. After that, your team can wrangle the data in preparation for machine learning.\n",

    "    - Get the data from S3 in your notebook and make data ready for machine learning.\n",

    "> Everything in this milestone is to be completed in sequential order. But if you want to divide the tasks, you can ask a team member to work on Task 2 (```4. Get the data that we wrangled in our first milestone.``` and ```6. Wrangle the data in preparation for machine learning```) locally on their laptop while the other members set up the infrastructure (EC2, S3) and TLJH in the cloud. This way, you can move quick.\n",
