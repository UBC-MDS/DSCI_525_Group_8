# Predicting Rainfall in Australia

## About

This project aims to build and deploy an ensemble machine learning model to predict daily rainfall in Australia. We use a large dataset of about 6GB consisting of outputs of different climate models, with the target being the observed rainfall in mm/day. The dataset can be accessed here on [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681). The purpose of this project is to practice building ML models with a focus on handling big data efficiently. The final ML model will be deployed on the cloud and can be used by others.
